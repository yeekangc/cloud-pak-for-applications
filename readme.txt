# Monolithic to Microservices Architecture using Cloud Pak for Applications

In this tutorial , we will learn how to use Cloud Pak for Applications to break down our monolithic (Core Banking) application implemented in Node.js into microservices.  

## Cloud Pak for Applications:
The IBM Cloud Pak™ for Applications provides a complete and consistent experience to speed development of applications built for Kubernetes, using agile DevOps processes.

Running on Red Hat® OpenShift®, IBM Cloud Pak for Applications provides a hybrid, multicloud foundation built on open standards, enabling workloads and data to run anywhere. It integrates two main opensource platforms [Kabanero](https://kabanero.io/) and [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/).



## Prerequisites:

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you need to:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your local machine.

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for local development.

3. Get access to a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster, with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications from [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/openshiftcluster?cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg).

4. Must have Github account 

## Steps:
1. [Clone and understand the architecture of monolithic application](#1-clone-and-understand-the-architecture-of-monolithic-application)
2. [Understand how to break down our monolithic application](#2-understand-how-to-break-down-our-monolithic-application)
3. [Install Codewind in Visual Studio to create microserivces test and deploy to github](#3-install-codewind-in-visual-studio- to-create-microserivces-test-and-deploy-to-github)
4. [Intialize Tekton and integrate with github repository](#4-intialize-tekton-and-integrate-with-github-repository)
5. [Verify if the microservices are up and running](#5-verify-if-the-microservices-are-up-and-running)


### 1. Clone and understand the architecture of monolithic application

1. We'll use this repo as it contains our Banking Monolithic Application. 
2. Open your terminal and change your directory by using the cd downloads command. (Or any other directory in which you want to clone the project)
3. Run command `https://github.com/mahsankhaan/cloud-pak-for-applications.git`.   
4. Open the project in Visual Studio.

#### Architecture of the monolithic application

![GitHub Logo](images/m1.png)

There are 5 services under "views" folder running in a single project that are tightly coupled. If we get a traffic on a single service , complete project goes down that is one of the major disadvantage of monolithic architecture.

### 2. Understand how to break down our monolithic application

There are 5 services running in the project , lets break down our monolithic application by evaluating which services are tightly coupled and on the high load on that service can effect the other services and maybe complete project. So let breakdown admin and customer services.

There will be two microservices.

1. Admin Microservice
2. Customer Microservice

### 3. Install Codewind in Visual Studio to create microserivce test and deploy to github
Once we have decided which service needs to be converted into micro-services  , initialize codewind in our visual studio that will help us to do local development , testing services and containerizing it. Please follow the below steps to work with codewind:

1. Open VisualStudio.
2. On the left select Extensions and search for Codewind.
3. Select Install and kindly wait it will take some time to initialize.
4. Once successfully installed you'll be able to see "Codewind" section on the left
5. Select **Codewind** and start local codewind.
6. Right click on local and select **Create New Project** 
7. Select templete **Kabanero Node.js Express simple template**
8. Name it as **micro-admin**.
9. Now your structure will be something like

10. Select Codewind and **build the project** , application must be up and running.
11. Test your application by right clicking micro-admin -> **Application Monitor** and hit the application 2 or 3 times to see the changes.

12. Run `appsody build` so that application would be ready to deploy on any cloud.
13. After the command executed successfully on left there will be new file named as **app-deploy.yaml**.
14. Follow steps form 1-13 to create 2 microservice **micro-User** 

15. Once two microservices are created we can upload it to centeral repositry **github**.

If we face any difficulty in creating microservices please take a look here:
1. [Admin-microservice](https://github.com/mahsankhaan/micro-admin.git)
2. [User-microservice](https://github.com/mahsankhaan/micro-user.git)

### 4. Intialize Tekton and integrate with github repository

Before we instailize Tekton it is really important to have github token ,so lets create two tokens for admin and user.
Settings -> Developer settings -> personal access token -> generate new token

Once both tokens are created you will able to see below image:

**IMPORTANT : Please copy the token ,as you won’t be able to see it again! **


Tekton :
Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems.
To know about it please visit [here](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/introduction-to-tekton-architecture-and-design/)

Please follow below steps to intialize Tekton:
1. Open Openshift Web Console.
2. Once you are logged in successfully , select **Kabanero** from my project section.
3. From left menu select **Cloud Pak for Applications**
4. Now you can see the below screen.

![GitHub Logo](images/s4.png)

5. Please go to Instance ,in Tools section select  **tekton** link and you will be redirected to below image.

6. Select **Webhook** from left menu and create two webhook for

a. micro-admin

![GitHub Logo](images/s7.png)

b. micro-user 

![GitHub Logo](images/s11.png)


7 . Now check if tekton and github are successfully connected. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE** Don't worry if you are getting red sign, it will turn green once the repo code is updated)

8. Do some changes to github repositry and you will see it is successfully deployed.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : First do the changes in admin repo and once it is successfully deployed then update the user repo.

### 5. Verify if the microservices are up and running
1. Open Openshift dashboard.
2. Once dashboard is open from left menu select Application.
3. Go in routes and there will be two services up and running.
4. To run the application click links in **Hostname**
